# Low pass filter simulation with an PWM input signal
Simulates a low pass filter circuit that plots the PWM signal input and filterd output.

## Simulation parameters
You can change the sampling rate depending on how realistic (but using more computation power) you want the result to be.\
You can change the total time depending on how long you want your simulation to last.

## Low pass filter parameters
You can change the resistance in ohms and the capacitance in farads to your desired values.

## PWM parameters
You can change the pwm frequency to your preferred frequency.\
You can change the duty cycle to your preferred percentage, however the value needs to be a fraction. So for example, for a 20% duty cycle you would need to enter 0.2 as your duty cycle value.\
You can change the input voltage to your preferred voltage.
